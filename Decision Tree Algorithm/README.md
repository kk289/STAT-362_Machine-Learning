## Training and Visualizing a decision trees

# What are Decision Trees?
Decision trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithm that can perform both classification and regression tasks. They are very powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets. Besides, decision trees are fundamental components of random forests, which are among the most potent Machine Learning algorithms available today.

# About this project
- The purpose of this dataset is to predict which people are more likely to survive after the collision of titanic ship with the iceberg.
- The dataset contains 13 variables and 1309 observations. The dataset is ordered by the variable x.
- Starting from importing data, then cleaning the data
- Split the data into train and test data
- Build the model
- Make a prediction
- Measure the perfomance by Confusion Matrix
- Tune the hyper-parameters
