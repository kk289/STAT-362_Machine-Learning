## Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

I followed the topic project from the link give below and practiced the coding.

About the project: 
- This Project discuss about the Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and R Concepts.
- To carry out this project, we use the card transcations dataset that contains a mix of fraud plus non-fraudulent transcations.
- Perform this projects using following alorgithms:
  1. Decision Trees
  2. Logistic Regression Model
  3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  4. Gradient Boosting Classifier
